## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

- Live Site URL: [Article preview component / Vercel deployment](https://fm-article-preview-component-khaki.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Instead of including an SVG as src in the img-tag, I inserted the SVG directly into the button element. This allowed me to address the fill value directly in the CSS.

### Continued development

Maybe there could better approaches for the article-footer, displaying the share-popup and toggeling show and hide. I will be looking for suggestions for this in the future and collecting other ideas.

### Useful resources
